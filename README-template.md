What I Learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of layout design and responsive styling using Flexbox.
I also practiced creating consistent hover states and refining visual hierarchy using spacing and typography.

Here’s a snippet of code I’m proud of:

.social-link:hover {
background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

Focus more on accessibility and keyboard navigation

Explore using CSS animations and transitions for smoother interactions

Continue improving my responsive design skills
